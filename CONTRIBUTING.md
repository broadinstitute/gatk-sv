## Your First Code Contribution

All code contributions to the GATK-SV repository are made through 
[pull requests (PR)](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests), 
and you may take the following steps to prepare and submit your PRs.

### Fork GATK-SV (one time)
A [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks) 
is your copy of a GitHub repository that you can make your changes 
without affecting the source.

You may create a fork of [broadinstitute/gatk-sv](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-sv) 
following [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository).

### Clone GATK-SV fork (one time)

Once you have forked [broadinstitute/gatk-sv](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-sv), 
you need to download your fork to your computer so you can implement any changes. 
This process is commonly known as _cloning_ a GitHub repository. You may follow 
[these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#cloning-your-forked-repository) 
on cloning your fork of GATK-SV, or you may run the following commands.

Clone your fork
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/gatk-sv ./gatk-sv
$ cd gatk-sv
```

Add a reference to `broadinstitute/gatk-sv` so you can keep your fork in synch in the future.

```shell
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-sv
```

### Create a feature branch (once per feature)

In a loose sense, a [_branch_](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches) 
is an isolated copy of the code in your forked repository, where the changes 
you implement in one branch does not affect the code on the other branches. 
It is a common practice to create one branch per each feature you would like 
to implement, and do not implement features on the `main` branch of the repository. 
It is mainly because you can use the `main` branch to synchronize your fork with 
the upstream and get a fresh copy of the up-to-date codebase to start your feature development. 

You may create a branch using [Github](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository) 
or [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging). 
In a nutshell, you may create a branch with the following steps.

Ensure you are on the `main` branch.  
```shell
$ git checkout main
```

Create a branch
```shell
$ git checkout -b YOUR-BRANCH-NAME
```
Synchronize your branch with `broadinstitute/gatk-sv`. 
```shell
$ git fetch upstream
$ git merge upstream/master
```

Push your branch to GitHub
```shell
$ git push â€“set-upstream origin YOUR-BRANCH-NAME
```
### Implement a new feature or fix a bug

You may open the code base in any text editor or integrated development environment (IDE). 
We recommend using [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) or 
[Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/), 
which are both freely available. Please follow the following guidelines 
when making changes to the codebase.

- **Coding Style**: GATK-SV is composed of code written in various programming languages, 
including WDL, Python, Bash, and R. Please follow the styling guidelines of each programming 
language; e.g., [PEP-8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) for Python.

- **Documentation**: Please add concise and descriptive documentation to your changes.



### Commit changes
_Commiting_ changes means tracking them via _git_. You may submit a change in 
one commit or split it into multiple related commits. Though there is no hard 
rule on splitting your commits, there are 
[best practices](https://github.blog/2022-06-30-write-better-commits-build-better-projects/) 
that we highly recommend. In GATK-SV, we 
[`squash and merge`](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/about-pull-request-merges#squash-and-merge-your-commits) 
pull requests, which squashes all the commits into a single commit and 
merge on the `main` branch.

You may commit changes to git from within your IDE or from the terminal with the `git commit` command:

```shell
$ git commit -m "commit message"
```

### Make a pull request

The commits you created are tracked on the feature branch of your fork. 
To bring these changes to GATK-SV, you need to create a pull request. 
You may follow these guidelines on 
[creating a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request?tool=webui&platform=windows). 
When creating a pull request, please provide concise and descriptive 
information on the expected behavior, thoroughly test your changes and 
provide minimally reproducible steps to test your code. After your pull 
request is reviewed and approved, your commits can be squash-committed 
to the `main` branch of GATK-SV.
