# Terra Workspace

You may run GATK-SV in a [Terra](https://app.terra.bio) [Workspace](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/sections/360004538992-Workspaces).
The Terra workspace discussed on this page runs on an instance of Terra that 
is deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), hence, we refer to the GCP 
resources when needed.

# Prerequisite

- Set up a [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com/gcp) account to work with Terra, 
[following this documentation](https://terra.bio/resources/getting-started/). After this step, 
you should have a GCP account configured, set up a billing project, and created on account on 
[Terra](https://app.terra.bio) using your GCP account. 

# Demo Run on Terra
We have prepared a [GATK-SV demo Terra workspace](https://app.terra.bio/#workspaces/broad-firecloud-dsde-methods/gatk-sv-pipeline-1kgp)
where you can run GATK-SV on publicly available short-read sequencing data from the 
[1000 Genomes Project](https://www.internationalgenome.org). The workspace contains 
a `README` file that provides detailed description on running the workflow.
