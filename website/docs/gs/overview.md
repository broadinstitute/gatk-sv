# Overview

This section provides guidance on how GATK-SV can be used, restrictions on input data, and where to get started 
with generating call sets.

We highly recommend that users new to SV calling also review the [Best Practices Guide](/docs/best_practices).

Most users should use the Terra platform for running GATK-SV and, after reading this section,
should refer to the documentation in the [Execution section](/docs/execution/overview) for instructions on 
how to run their own data.
