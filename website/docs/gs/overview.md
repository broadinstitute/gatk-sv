# Overview

GATK-SV is a highly-scalable cloud-native pipeline for structural variation discovery 
on Illumina short-read whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data.
The pipeline genotypes structural variations using Docker-based tools, modularized in 
different components, and orchestrated using Cromwell.

We support running the pipeline in the following environments. 

- [Terra.bio](terra.md);
- [Cromwell](cromwell.md).
