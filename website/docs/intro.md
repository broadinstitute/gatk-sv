GATK-SV is a comprehensive, cloud-based ensemble pipeline for discovering and annotating all 
classes of structural variants (SV) from whole genome sequencing (WGS) data. It can detect 
deletions, duplications, multi-allelic copy number variants, balanced inversions, 
insertions, translocations, and a diverse spectrum of complex SV. Briefly, GATK-SV 
maximizes the sensitivity of SV discovery by harmonizing output from five tools: 
Manta, Wham, Scramble, cnMOPS, and GATK-gCNV. To minimize false positives, raw SVs 
are adjudicated and re-genotyped from read evidence considering all potential 
sequencing evidence including anomalous paired-end (PE) reads, split reads (SR), 
read-depth (RD), and B-allele frequencies (BAF). It also fully resolves 16 classes of complex 
SVs composed of multiple breakpoints. GATK-SV is intended for use on the [Terra](https://app.terra.bio/) 
 platform.

### Methods

Further details about GATK-SV methods can be found in [Collins et al. 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2287-8).
