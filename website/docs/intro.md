# About

Structural variants are key players in human evolution and 
disease, but they are difficult to discover and analyze. 
There are many tools out there to discover structural variants; 
some algorithms are specialized to detect certain structural 
variants or only work with certain SV categories. GATK-SV is 
an ensemble method that specializes in bringing together 
the best evidence from each tool in a high quality format. 
In this article, we will go over the evidence categories 
for detecting structural variants and the structural variant 
types that we report in GATK-SV.
