[WDL source code](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-sv/blob/main/wdl/MainVcfQC.wdl)

Creates plots for call set analysis and quality control (QC). This module is run by default with the 
[FilterGenotypes](./fg) module. Note, however, that the module is a stand-alone workflow and can be used with any batch- 
or cohort-level (i.e. multi-sample) SV VCF, including outputs from [ClusterBatch](./cb) and onward.

Users can optionally provide external benchmarking datasets with the 
[site_level_comparison_datasets](#optional-site_level_comparison_datasets) and 
[sample_level_comparison_datasets](#optional-sample_level_comparison_datasets) parameters.

The following sections provide guidance on interpreting these plots for VCFs that have been run with the recommended 
pipeline through [FilterGenotypes](./fg).

### Output structure

The tarball output has the following directory structure:

- `/plots/main_plots` : main QC plots, described in detail [below](#plots-description).
- `/plots/supplementary_plots` : comprehensive set of QC plots with greater detail, some of which are used as panels 
  in `main_plots`.
- `/data` : various datafiles from the QC process such as family structures, a list of the samples
  used for plotting, variant statistics, and lists of overlapping variants against any external call sets provided.

### Plots description

This section summarizes the most important plots used for overall call set QC found in the `/plots/main_plots` 
directory. 

Example plots are provided from a high-quality dataset consisting of 161 samples from the 1000 Genomes Project aligned 
with DRAGEN v3.7.8. Note that QC metrics and distributions will vary among data sets, particularly as sample size 
increases, and these examples are intended to provide a simple baseline for acceptable call set quality. Please see 
the [Recommendations](#recommendations) section for prescribed quality criteria.

:::note
The following plots are of variants passing all filters (i.e. with the `FILTER` status set to `PASS`). This is the 
default behavior of the QC plots generated in [FilterGenotypes](./fg). 

When running `MainVcfQc` as a standalone workflow, users may set the 
[bcftools_preprocessing_options](#optional--bcftools_preprocessing_options) argument to limit plotted variants based on `FILTER` status.
For example, to limit to `PASS` variants for a VCF generated from [FilterGenotypes](./fg) use:
```
"bcftools_preprocessing_options": "-i 'FILTER~\"PASS\""
```

#### SV per genome

Shows per-genome SV count distributions broken down by SV type. The top row is a site-level analysis, and 
the bottom row provides counts of individual alleles. Distributions of genotype quality (`GQ`), SV size, and 
frequency are also shown.

#### SV counts

Summarizes total variant counts by type, frequency, and size.

#### Genotype distributions

Distributions of genotypes across the call set. 

The left panel plots carrier frequency against allele frequency and can be used to visualize genotyping bias. In this 
plot, the rolling mean should not lie on the lower or upper extremes (all het. or all hom.).

The middle panel plots the Hardy-Weinberg (HW) distribution of the cohort and provides estimates for the proportions of 
variants in HW equilibrium (or nominally in HW equilibrium before a multiple testing correction). The right-hand 
plots stratify HW by SV size.

:::note
The horizontal line bisecting the vertical axis in the AF vs. carrier frequency plot was fixed in.

#### <HighlightOptionalArg>Optional</HighlightOptionalArg> SV trio inheritance

Inheritance analysis of sites and alleles, including *de novo* rate distributions by SV class, size, frequency, and 
genotype quality. This plot is only generated if the cohort contains trios defined in the [PED file](#optional-ped_file).

#### <HighlightOptionalArg>Optional</HighlightOptionalArg> Call set benchmarking

This plot will be generated for each external call set provided. The left-hand panels show distributions of overlapping 
variants in the input VCF by SV class, size, and frequency. Colors depict proportions of variants meeting each overlap 
criterion. The right-hand panels show distributions among variants overlapping between the input and external call sets 
by SV class, size, and frequency. 

:::note
Note the horizontal line bisecting the vertical axis in the AF vs. AF plot has been fixed in 
[#625](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-sv/pull/625)).

### Recommendations

We suggest users observe the following basic criteria to assess the overall quality of the final call set:

* Number of PASS variants per genome (which excludes `BND`) between 7,000 and 11,000.
* Relative overall proportions of SV types similar to those shown above.
* Similar size and frequency distributions to those shown above.
* At least 70% of variants in HW equilibrium. Note that this may be lower depending on how well 
  the underlying cohort population structure adheres to the assumptions of the HW model. Note that HW equilibrium 
  usually improves after genotype filtering.
* Strong allele frequency correlation against an external benchmarking dataset such as gnomAD-v2.
* Low allele *de novo* inheritance rate (if trios are present), typically below 10%.

These are intended as general guidelines and not strict limits on call set quality.

### Inputs

#### `vcfs`
Array of one or more input VCFs. Each VCF must be indexed. This input is structured as an `Array` type for convenience 
when VCFs are sharded by contig. All VCFs in the array are concatenated before processing.

#### <HighlightOptionalArg>Optional</HighlightOptionalArg>  `vcf_format_has_cn`
Default: `true`. This must be set to `false` for VCFs from modules before [CleanVcf](./cvcf) (i.e. without `CN` fields).

#### <HighlightOptionalArg>Optional</HighlightOptionalArg>  `bcftools_preprocessing_options`
Additional arguments to pass to [bcftools view](https://samtools.github.io/bcftools/bcftools.html) before running 
the VCF through QC tools.

#### <HighlightOptionalArg>Optional</HighlightOptionalArg> `ped_file`
Family structures and sex assignments determined in [EvidenceQC](./eqc). See [PED file format](/docs/gs/inputs#ped-format).
If provided and there are trios present then [SV trio plots](#optional-sv-trio-inheritance) will be generated.

#### <HighlightOptionalArg>Optional</HighlightOptionalArg> `list_of_samples_to_include`
If provided, the input VCF(s) will be subset to samples in the list.

#### <HighlightOptionalArg>Optional</HighlightOptionalArg> `sample_renaming_tsv`
File with mapping to rename per-sample benchmark sample IDs for compatibility with cohort (see 
[here](/docs/resources#hgsv_byrska_bishop_sample_renaming_tsv) for example).

#### <HighlightOptionalArg>Optional</HighlightOptionalArg> `max_trios`
Default: `1000`. Upper limit on the number of trios to use for inheritance analysis.

#### `prefix`
Output prefix, such as cohort name. May be alphanumeric with underscores.

#### `sv_per_shard`
Records per shard for parallel processing. This parameter may be reduced if the workflow is running slowly.

#### `samples_per_shard`
Samples per shard for per-sample QC processing. This parameter may be reduced if the workflow is running slowly. Only 
has an effect when [do_per_sample_qc](#optional-do_per_sample_qc) is enabled.

#### <HighlightOptionalArg>Optional</HighlightOptionalArg> `do_per_sample_qc`
Default: `true`. If enabled, performs per-sample SV count plots, family analysis, and site-level benchmarking.

#### <HighlightOptionalArg>Optional</HighlightOptionalArg> `site_level_comparison_datasets`
Array of two-element arrays, one per dataset, each a tuple containing `[prefix, bed_uri_path]`, where the latter is 
a directory containing multiple bed files containing the call set stratified by subpopulation. For example: 

```
["gnomAD_v2_Collins", "gs://gatk-sv-resources-public/hg38/v0/sv-resources/resources/v1/gnomAD_v2_Collins"]
```

where the bucket directory contains the following files:

```
gs://gatk-sv-resources-public/hg38/v0/sv-resources/resources/v1/gnomAD_v2_Collins/gnomAD_v2_Collins.SV.AFR.bed.gz
gs://gatk-sv-resources-public/hg38/v0/sv-resources/resources/v1/gnomAD_v2_Collins/gnomAD_v2_Collins.SV.ALL.bed.gz
