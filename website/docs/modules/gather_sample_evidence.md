Runs raw evidence collection on each sample with the following SV callers: 
Manta, Wham, Scramble, and/or MELT. For guidance on pre-filtering prior to GatherSampleEvidence, 
refer to the Sample Exclusion section.

The following diagram illustrates the downstream workflows of the `GatherSampleEvidence` workflow 
in the recommended invocation order. You may refer to 
[this diagram](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-sv/blob/main/terra_pipeline_diagram.jpg) 
for the overall recommended invocation order.

## Inputs

#### `bam_or_cram_file`
A BAM or CRAM file aligned to hg38. Index file (.bai) must be provided if using BAM.

#### `sample_id`
Refer to the [sample ID requirements](/docs/gs/inputs#sampleids) for specifications of allowable sample IDs. 
IDs that do not meet these requirements may cause errors.

#### `preprocessed_intervals`
Picard interval list.

#### `sd_locs_vcf`
(`sd`: site depth) 
A VCF file containing allele counts at common SNP loci of the genome, which is used for calculating BAF.  
For human genome, you may use [`dbSNP`](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/) 
that contains a complete list of common and clinical human single nucleotide variations, 
microsatellites, and small-scale insertions and deletions. 
You may find a link to the file in 
[this reference](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-sv/blob/main/inputs/values/resources_hg38.json).
