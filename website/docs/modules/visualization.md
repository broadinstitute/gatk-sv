Visualize SVs with IGV screenshots and read depth plots.

Visualization methods include:

- RD Visualization - generate RD plots across all samples, ideal for visualizing large CNVs.
- IGV Visualization - generate IGV plots of each SV for individual sample, ideal for visualizing de novo small SVs.
- Module09.visualize.wdl - generate RD plots and IGV plots, and combine them for easy review.
