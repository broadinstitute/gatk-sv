# GATK-SV
GATK-SV is a structural variation discovery pipeline for Illumina short-read whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. 

Before you begin processing, please read the full pipeline documentation in the README in the [GATK-SV GitHub repository](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-sv). This dashboard will focus on additional information specific to Terra and cannot substitute for the full documentation.

## Data
The sample data in this workspace is 312 publicly-available 1000 Genomes Project samples from the [NYGC/AnVIL high coverage data set](https://app.terra.bio/#workspaces/anvil-datastorage/1000G-high-coverage-2019), divided into two equally-sized batches.

## Pipeline Expectations
### What does it do? 
This pipeline performs structural variation discovery from CRAMs, joint genotyping, and variant resolution on a cohort of samples. 

### Required inputs
The following inputs must be provided for each sample in the cohort, via the sample table described in **Workspace Setup** step 2:

|Input Type|Input Name|Description|
|---------|--------|--------------|
|`String`|`sample_id`|Case sample identifier*|
|`File`|`bam_or_cram_file`|Path to the GCS location of the input CRAM or BAM file. If using BAM files, an index `.bai` file must either be present in the same directory, or the path must be provided with the input `bam_or_cram_index`.|
|`Boolean`|`requester_pays_cram`|Set to `true` if the case data is stored in a requester-pays GCS bucket|

*See **Sample ID requirements** below for specifications.

The following cohort-level or batch-level inputs are also required:

|Input Type|Input Name|Description|
|---------|--------|--------------|
|`String`|`sample_set_id`|Batch identifier|
|`String`|`sample_set_set_id`|Cohort identifier|
|`File`|`cohort_ped_file`|Path to the GCS location of a family structure definitions file in [PED format](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035531972-PED-Pedigree-format). Sex aneuploidies (detected in `02-EvidenceQC`) should be entered as sex = 0.|

### Pipeline outputs

The following are the main pipeline outputs. For more information on the outputs of each module, refer to the [README](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-sv).

|Output Type|Output Name|Description|
|---------|--------|--------------|
|`File`|`output_vcf`|Annotated SV VCF for the cohort***|
|`File`|`output_vcf_idx`|Index for `output_vcf`|
|`File`|`sv_vcf_qc_output`|QC plots (bundled in a .tar.gz file)|

***Note that this VCF is not filtered

### Pipeline overview

<img alt="pipeline_diagram" title="Pipeline diagram" src="https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-sv/blob/v0.18.1-beta/terra_pipeline_diagram.jpg?raw=true" width="1000">

The following workflows are included in this workspace, to be executed in this order:

1. `01-GatherSampleEvidence`: Per-sample SV evidence collection, including calls from a configurable set of algorithms (Manta, MELT, and Wham), read depth (RD), split read positions (SR), and discordant pair positions (PE).
2. `02-EvidenceQC`: Dosage bias scoring and ploidy estimation, run on preliminary batches
3. `03-TrainGCNV`: Per-batch training of a gCNV model for use in `04-GatherBatchEvidence`
4. `04-GatherBatchEvidence`: Per-batch copy number variant calling using cn.MOPS and GATK gCNV; B-allele frequency (BAF) generation; call and evidence aggregation
5. `05-ClusterBatch`: Per-batch variant clustering
6. `06-GenerateBatchMetrics`: Per-batch variant filtering, metric generation
7. `07-FilterBatchSites`: Per-batch variant filtering
8. `08-PlotSVCountsPerSample`: Plot SV counts per sample per SV type to enable choice of IQR cutoff for outlier filtration in `09-FilterBatchSamples`
9. `09-FilterBatchSamples`: Per-batch outlier sample filtration
10. (Skip for a single batch) `10-MergeBatchSites`: Site merging of SVs discovered across batches, run on a cohort-level `sample_set_set`
11. `11-GenotypeBatch`: Per-batch genotyping of all sites in the cohort. Use `11-GenotypeBatch_SingleBatch` if you only have one batch.
12. `12-RegenotypeCNVs`: Cohort-level genotype refinement of some depth calls. Use `12-RegenotypeCNVs_SingleBatch` if you only have one batch.
13. `13-CombineBatches`: Cohort-level cross-batch integration and clustering. Use `13-CombineBatches_SingleBatch` if you only have one batch.
14. `14-ResolveComplexVariants`: Complex variant resolution. Use `14-ResolveComplexVariants_SingleBatch` if you only have one batch.
15. `15-GenotypeComplexVariants`: Complex variant re-genotyping. Use `15-GenotypeComplexVariants_SingleBatch` if you only have one batch.
16. `16-CleanVcf`: VCF cleanup. Use `16-CleanVcf_SingleBatch` if you only have one batch.
17. `17-MasterVcfQc`: Generates VCF QC reports. Use `17-MasterVcfQc_SingleBatch` if you only have one batch.
18. `18-AnnotateVcf`: Cohort VCF annotations, including functional annotation, allele frequency (AF) annotation, and AF annotation with external population callsets. Use `18-AnnotateVcf_SingleBatch` if you only have one batch.

Additional downstream modules, such as those for filtering and visualization, are under development. They are not included in this workspace at this time, but the source code can be found in the [GATK-SV GitHub repository](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-sv). See **Downstream steps** towards the bottom of this page for more information.

Extra workflows (Not part of canonical pipeline, but included for your convenience. May require manual configuration):
* `FilterOutlierSamples`: Filter outlier samples (in terms of SV counts) from a single VCF. Recommended to run `08-PlotSVCountsPerSample` beforehand (reconfigured with the single VCF you want to filter) to enable IQR cutoff choice.

For detailed instructions on running the pipeline in Terra, see **Step-by-step instructions** below.

### How many samples can I process at once?

#### Single-sample vs. single-batch vs. multi-batch mode

There are three modes for this pipeline according to the number of samples you need to process:

1. Single-sample mode (<100 samples): The cohort mode of this pipeline requires at least 100 samples, so for smaller sets of samples we recommend the single-sample version of this pipeline, which is available as a [featured Terra workspace](https://app.terra.bio/#workspaces/help-gatk/GATK-Structural-Variants-Single-Sample).
2. Single-batch mode (100-500 samples)
3. Cohort (multi-batch) mode (>200 samples): Batches should be 100-500 samples, so you may choose to divide your cohort into multiple batches if you have at least 200 samples. Refer to the [Batching](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-sv#batching) section of the README for further information.


#### What is the maximum number of samples the pipeline can handle?

In Terra, we have tested batch sizes of up to 500 samples and cohort sizes of up to 1000 samples. On a separate cromwell server, we have tested the pipeline on cohorts of up to ~140,000 samples, but Terra's metadata handling will likely limit cohort sizes further.


### Time and cost estimates

The following estimates pertain to the 1000 Genomes sample data in this workspace. They represent aggregated run time and cost across modules for the whole pipeline. For workflows run multiple times (on each sample or on each batch), the longest individual runtime was used. Call caching may affect some of this information.

|Number of samples|Time|Total run cost|Per-sample run cost|
|--------------|--------|----------|----------|
|312|~76 hours|~$675|~$2.16/sample|

Please note that sample characteristics, cohort size, and level of filtering may influence pipeline compute costs, with average costs ranging between $2-$3 per sample. For instance, PCR+ samples and samples with a high percentage of improperly paired reads have been observed to cost more. Consider [excluding low-quality samples](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-sv#sample-exclusion) prior to processing to keep costs low.

## Running GATK-SV on your data in Terra
This section will cover how to run the pipeline on your own data in Terra.

### Sample ID requirements 

Refer to [the Sample ID Requirements section of the README](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-sv#sample-id-requirements) for sample ID requirements for the pipeline. IDs that do not meet these requirements may cause errors.

The same requirements apply to family IDs in the PED file, batch IDs (`sample_set_id`), and the cohort ID (`sample_set_set_id`).

Sample IDs are provided to `01-GatherSampleEvidence` directly and need not match sample names from the BAM/CRAM headers or GVCFs. We recommend transforming sample IDs using [this script](https://github.com/talkowski-lab/gnomad_sv_v3/blob/master/sample_id/convert_sample_ids.py) prior to uploading your sample data table. (Currently, sample IDs can be replaced again in `04-GatherBatchEvidence`.) The following files will need to be updated with the transformed sample IDs:
* Sample data table (for Terra)
* PED file
* Sample set membership file (for Terra)

If using a SNP VCF in `04-GatherBatchEvidence`, it does not need to be re-headered; simply provide the `vcf_samples` argument. An easy way to provide these sample IDs is to add a column `vcf_sample_id` to the sample TSV you upload to the workspace (see **Workspace setup** step 2 below), then reference this column as `this.samples.vcf_sample_id` in the `04-GatherBatchEvidence` inputs.


### Workspace setup

1. Clone this workspace into a Terra project to which you have access

2. In your new workspace, delete the sample, sample_set, and sample_set_set data tables. To do this, go to the *Data* tab of the workspace. Select the `sample` data table. Check the box to select all samples. Click the 3 blue dots that appear, and select "Delete Data". Confirm when prompted. Repeat for any remaining samples and for any remaining entries in the `sample_set` or `sample_set_set` tables. 
<img alt="deleting data tables" title="How to delete the sample data table" src="https://i.imgur.com/jNSXAqj.png" width="600">

3. Create and upload a new sample data table for your samples. This should be a tab-separated file (.tsv) with one line per sample, as well as a header (first) line. It should contain the columns `entity:sample_id` (first column), `bam_or_cram_file`, and `requester_pays_cram` at minimum. See the **Required inputs** section above for more information on these inputs. For an example sample data table, refer to the sample data table for the 1000 Genomes samples in this workspace [here in the GATK-SV GitHub repository](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-sv/blob/master/input_templates/terra_workspaces/cohort_mode/samples_1kgp.tsv.tmpl). To upload the TSV file, navigate to the *Data* tab of the workspace and click the `+` button next to "Tables".  
<img alt="uploading a TSV data table" title="How to upload a TSV data table" src="https://i.imgur.com/h0hj2fT.png" width="400">

4. Edit the `cohort_ped_file` item in the Workspace Data table (as shown in the screenshot below) to provide the Google URI to the PED file for your cohort (make sure to share it with your Terra proxy account!). 
<img alt="editing cohort_ped_file" title="How to edit the cohort_ped_file attribute" src="https://i.imgur.com/IFwc0gs.png" width="800">


#### Creating sample_sets 

To create batches (in the `sample_set` table), the easiest way is to upload a tab-separated sample set membership file. This file should have one line per sample, plus a header (first) line. The first column should be `membership:sample_set_id` (containing the `sample_set_id` for the sample in question), and the second should be `sample` (containing the sample IDs). Recall that batch IDs (`sample_set_id`) should follow the **Sample ID requirements** laid out above. For an example sample membership file, refer to the one for the 1000 Genomes samples in this workspace [here in the GATK-SV GitHub repository](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-sv/blob/master/input_templates/terra_workspaces/cohort_mode/sample_set_membership_1kgp.tsv.tmpl).


### Workflow instructions

#### General recommendations

* It is recommended to run each workflow first on one sample/batch to check that the method is properly configured before you attempt to process all of your data.
* We recommend enabling call-caching (on by default in each workflow configuration).
* We recommend enabling automatic intermediate file deletion by checking the box labeled "Delete intermediate outputs" at the top of the workflow launch page every time you start a workflow. With this option enabled, intermediate files (those not present in the Terra data table, and not needed for any further GATK-SV processing) will be deleted automatically if the workflow succeeds. If the workflow fails, the outputs will be retained to enable a re-run to pick up where it left off with call-caching. However, call-caching will not be possible for workflows that have succeeded. For more information on this option, see [this article](https://terra.bio/delete-intermediates-option-now-available-for-workflows-in-terra/). For guidance on managing intermediate storage from failed workflows, or from workflows without the delete intermediates option enabled, see the next bullet point.
* There are cases when you may need to manage storage in other ways: for workflows that failed (only delete files from a failed workflow after a version has succeeded, to avoid disabling call-caching), for workflows without intermediate file deletion enabled, or once you are done processing and want to delete files from earlier steps in the pipeline that you no longer need. 
	* One option is to manually delete large files, or directories containing failed workflow intermediates (after re-running the workflow successfully to take advantage of call-caching) with the command `gsutil -m rm gs://path/to/workflow/directory/**file_extension_to_delete` to delete all files with the given extension for that workflow, or `gsutil -m rm -r gs://path/to/workflow/directory/` to delete an entire workflow directory (only after you are done with all the files!). Note that this can take a very long time for larger workflows, which may contain thousands of files.
	* Another option is to use the `fiss mop` API call to delete all files that do not appear in one of the Terra data tables (intermediate files). Always ensure that you are completely done with a step and you will not need to return before using this option, as it will break call-caching. See [this blog post](https://terra.bio/deleting-intermediate-workflow-outputs/) for more details. This can also be done [via the command line](https://github.com/broadinstitute/fiss/wiki/MOP:-reducing-your-cloud-storage-footprint).
* If your workflow fails, check the job manager for the error message. Most issues can be resolved by increasing the memory or disk. Do not delete workflow log files until you are done troubleshooting. If call-caching is enabled, do not delete any files from the failed workflow until you have run it successfully.
* To display run costs, see [this article](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360037862771#h_01EX5ED53HAZ59M29DRCG24CXY) for one-time setup instructions for non-Broad users.
* If you only have one batch, you will need to skip `10-MergeBatchSites` and use the single-batch versions of all workflows after `11-GenotypeBatch`.

#### 01-GatherSampleEvidence

Read the full GatherSampleEvidence documentation [here](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-sv#gather-sample-evidence).
* This workflow runs on a per-sample level, but you can launch many (a few hundred) samples at once, in arbitrary partitions. Make sure to try just one sample first though!
* Refer to the [Data section of the README](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-sv#data) for details on input files, sample exclusion, and sample IDs.
* It is normal for a few samples in a cohort to run out of memory during Wham SV calling, so we recommend enabling auto-retry for out-of-memory errors for `01-GatherSampleEvidence` only. Before you launch the workflow, click the checkbox reading "Retry with more memory" and set the memory retry factor to 1.8. This action must be performed each time you launch a `01-GatherSampleEvidence` job.
* Please note that most large published joint call sets produced by GATK-SV, including gnomAD-SV, included the tool MELT, a state-of-the-art mobile element insertion (MEI) detector, as part of the pipeline. Due to licensing restrictions, we cannot provide a public docker image for this algorithm. The `01-GatherSampleEvidence` workflow does not use MELT as one of the SV callers by default, which will result in less sensitivity to MEI calls. In order to use MELT, you will need to build your own private docker image (example Dockerfile [here](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-sv/blob/master/dockerfiles/melt/Dockerfile)), share it with your Terra proxy account, enter it in the `melt_docker` input in the `01-GatherSampleEvidence` configuration (as a string, surrounded by double-quotes), and then click "Save". No further changes are necessary beyond `01-GatherSampleEvidence`. 
	* Note that the version of MELT tested with GATK-SV is v2.0.5. If you use a different version to create your own docker image, we recommend testing your image by running one pilot sample through `01-GatherSampleEvidence` to check that it runs as expected, then running a small group of about 10 pilot samples through the pipeline until the end of `04-GatherBatchEvidence` to check that the outputs are compatible with GATK-SV.
* If you enable "Delete intermediate outputs" whenever you launch this workflow (recommended), BAM files will be deleted for successful runs; but BAM files will not be deleted if the run fails or if intermediate file deletion is not enabled. Since BAM files are large, we recommend deleting them to save on storage costs, but only after fixing and re-running the failed workflow, so that it will call-cache.


#### 02-EvidenceQC

Read the full EvidenceQC documentation [here](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-sv#evidence-qc).
* `02-EvidenceQC` is run on arbitrary cohort partitions of up to 500 samples.
* The outputs from `02-EvidenceQC` can be used for [preliminary sample QC](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-sv#preliminary-sample-qc) and [batching](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-sv#batching) before moving on to TrainGCNV.


#### 03-TrainGCNV

Read the full TrainGCNV documentation [here](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-sv#gcnv-training-1).
* By default, `03-TrainGCNV` is configured to be run once per `sample_set` on 100 randomly-chosen samples from that set to create a gCNV model for each batch. 
* Before running this workflow, create the batches (~100-500 samples) you will use for the rest of the pipeline based on sample coverage, WGD score (from `02-EvidenceQC`), and PCR status. These will likely not be the same as the batches you used for `02-EvidenceQC`.

#### 04-GatherBatchEvidence

Read the full GatherBatchEvidence documentation [here](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-sv#gather-batch-evidence).
* Use the same `sample_set` definitions you used for `03-TrainGCNV`.

#### 05-ClusterBatch and 06-GenerateBatchMetrics

Read the full documentation for these modules [here](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-sv#cluster-batch).
* Use the same `sample_set` definitions you used for `03-TrainGCNV` and `04-GatherBatchEvidence`.


#### 07-FilterBatchSites, 08-PlotSVCountsPerSample, 09-FilterBatchSamples

These three workflows make up FilterBatch; they are subdivided in this workspace to enable tuning of outlier filtration cutoffs. Read the full FilterBatch documentation [here](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-sv#filter-batch).
* Use the same `sample_set` definitions you used for `03-TrainGCNV` through `06-GenerateBatchMetrics`.
* `07-FilterBatchSites` does not require user intervention
* `08-PlotSVCountsPerSample` produces SV count plots and files, as well as a preview of the outlier samples to be filtered, but it does not perform any filtering of the VCFs. The input `N_IQR_cutoff` is used to visualize filtration thresholds on the SV count plots and preview the samples to be filtered; the default value is set to 6. You can adjust this value depending on your needs, and you can re-run the workflow with new `N_IQR_cutoff` values until the plots and outlier sample lists suit the purposes of your study. Once you have chosen an IQR cutoff, provide it to the `N_IQR_cutoff` input in `09-FilterBatchSamples` to filter the VCFs using the chosen cutoff.
* `09-FilterBatchSamples` performs outlier sample filtration, removing samples with an abnormal number of SV calls of at least one SV type. To tune the filtering threshold to your needs, edit the `N_IQR_cutoff` input value based on the plots and outlier sample preview lists from `08-PlotSVCountsPerSample`. The default value for `N_IQR_cutoff` in this step is 10000, which essentially means that no samples are filtered.

#### 10-MergeBatchSites

Read the full MergeBatchSites documentation [here](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-sv#merge-batch-sites).
* If you only have one batch, skip this workflow.
* For a multi-batch cohort, `10-MergeBatchSites` is a cohort-level workflow, so it is run on a `sample_set_set` containing all of the batches in the cohort. You can create this `sample_set_set` while you are launching the `10-MergeBatchSites` workflow: click "Select Data", choose "Create new sample_set_set [...]", check all the batches to include (all of the ones used in `03-TrainGCNV` through `09-FilterBatchSamples`), and give it a name that follows the **Sample ID requirements**.

<img alt="creating a cohort sample_set_set" title="How to create a cohort sample_set_set" src="https://i.imgur.com/zKEtSbe.png" width="500">

#### 11-GenotypeBatch

Read the full GenotypeBatch documentation [here](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-sv#genotype-batch).
* Use the same `sample_set` definitions you used for `03-TrainGCNV` through `09-FilterBatchSamples`.
* If you only have one batch, use the `11-GenotypeBatch_SingleBatch` version of the workflow.

#### 12-RegenotypeCNVs, 13-CombineBatches, 14-ResolveComplexVariants, 15-GenotypeComplexVariants, 16-CleanVcf, 17-MasterVcfQc, and 18-AnnotateVcf

Read the full documentation for [RegenotypeCNVs](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-sv#regenotype-cnvs), [MakeCohortVcf](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-sv#make-cohort-vcf) (which includes `CombineBatches`, `ResolveComplexVariants`, `GenotypeComplexVariants`, `CleanVcf`, `MasterVcfQc`), and [AnnotateVcf](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-sv#annotate-vcf) on the README.
* For a multi-batch cohort, use the same cohort `sample_set_set` you created and used for `10-MergeBatchSites`.
* If you only have one batch, use the `[...]_SingleBatch` version of the workflow.

#### Downstream steps

Additional downstream steps are under development. Read about some of them on the README [here](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-sv#module07). Please note that the VCF produced by `16-CleanVcf` (and annotated by `18-AnnotateVcf`) prioritizes sensitivity, but additional downstream filtration is recommended to improve specificity. Filtration methods are under active development by the GATK-SV team; stay tuned for updates.
