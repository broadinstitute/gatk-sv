## <a name="requirements">Requirements</a>


### Deployment and execution:
* A [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) account.
* A workflow execution system supporting the [Workflow Description Language](https://openwdl.org/) (WDL), either:
  * [Cromwell](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell) (v36 or higher). A dedicated server is highly recommended.
  * or [Terra](https://terra.bio/) (note preconfigured GATK-SV workflows are not yet available for this platform)
* Recommended: [MELT](https://melt.igs.umaryland.edu/). Due to licensing restrictions, we cannot provide a public docker image or reference panel VCFs for this algorithm.
* Recommended: [cromshell](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromshell) for interacting with a dedicated Cromwell server.
* Recommended: [WOMtool](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/WOMtool/) for validating WDL/json files.

### Data:
* Illumina short-read whole-genome CRAMs or BAMs, aligned to hg38 with [bwa-mem](https://github.com/lh3/bwa). BAMs must also be indexed.
* Indexed GVCFs produced by GATK HaplotypeCaller, or a jointly genotyped VCF.
* Family structure definitions file in [PED format](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035531972-PED-Pedigree-format). Sex aneuploidies (detected in [EvidenceQC](#evidence-qc)) should be entered as sex = 0.

#### <a name="sample-exclusion">Sample Exclusion</a>
We recommend filtering out samples with a high percentage of improperly paired reads (>10% or an outlier for your data) as technical outliers prior to running [GatherSampleEvidence](#gather-sample-evidence). A high percentage of improperly paired reads may indicate issues with library prep, degradation, or contamination. Artifactual improperly paired reads could cause incorrect SV calls, and these samples have been observed to have longer runtimes and higher compute costs for [GatherSampleEvidence](#gather-sample-evidence).

#### <a name="sampleids">Sample ID requirements:</a>

Sample IDs must:
* Be unique within the cohort
* Contain only alphanumeric characters and underscores (no dashes, whitespace, or special characters)

Sample IDs should not:
* Contain only numeric characters
* Be a substring of another sample ID in the same cohort
* Contain any of the following substrings: `chr`, `name`, `DEL`, `DUP`, `CPX`, `CHROM`

The same requirements apply to family IDs in the PED file, as well as batch IDs and the cohort ID provided as workflow inputs.

Sample IDs are provided to [GatherSampleEvidence](#gather-sample-evidence) directly and need not match sample names from the BAM/CRAM headers or GVCFs. `GetSampleID.wdl` can be used to fetch BAM sample IDs and also generates a set of alternate IDs that are considered safe for this pipeline; alternatively, [this script](https://github.com/talkowski-lab/gnomad_sv_v3/blob/master/sample_id/convert_sample_ids.py) transforms a list of sample IDs to fit these requirements. Currently, sample IDs can be replaced again in [GatherBatchEvidence](#gather-batch-evidence). 

The following inputs will need to be updated with the transformed sample IDs:
* Sample ID list for [GatherSampleEvidence](#gather-sample-evidence) or [GatherBatchEvidence](#gather-batch-evidence)
* PED file

If using a SNP VCF in [GatherBatchEvidence](#gather-batch-evidence), it does not need to be re-headered; simply provide the `vcf_samples` argument.

## <a name="quickstart">Quickstart</a>

#### WDLs
There are two scripts for running the full pipeline:
* `wdl/GATKSVPipelineBatch.wdl`: Runs GATK-SV on a batch of samples.
* `wdl/GATKSVPipelineSingleSample.wdl`: Runs GATK-SV on a single sample, given a reference panel

#### Inputs
Example workflow inputs can be found in `/input_templates` or `/test_input_templates`. All required resources are available in public Google buckets.

#### MELT
**Important**: The example input files contain MELT inputs that are NOT public (see [Requirements](#requirements)). These include:

* `GATKSVPipelineSingleSample.melt_docker` and `GATKSVPipelineBatch.melt_docker` - MELT docker URI (see [Docker readme](https://github.com/talkowski-lab/gatk-sv-v1/blob/master/dockerfiles/README.md))
* `GATKSVPipelineSingleSample.ref_std_melt_vcfs` - Standardized MELT VCFs ([GatherBatchEvidence](#gather-batch-evidence))

The input values are provided only as an example and are not publicly accessible. In order to include MELT, these values must be provided by the user. MELT can be disabled by deleting these inputs and setting `GATKSVPipelineBatch.use_melt` to `false`.

#### Requester pays buckets
**Important**: The following parameters must be set when certain input data is in requester pays (RP) buckets:

* `GATKSVPipelineSingleSample.requester_pays_cram` and `GATKSVPipelineBatch.GatherSampleEvidenceBatch.requester_pays_crams` - set to `True` if inputs are CRAM format and in an RP bucket, otherwise `False`.
* `GATKSVPipelineBatch.GATKSVPipelinePhase1.gcs_project_for_requester_pays` - set to your Google Cloud Project ID if gVCFs are in an RP bucket, otherwise omit this parameter.

#### Execution
We recommend running the pipeline on a dedicated [Cromwell](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell) server with a [cromshell](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromshell) client. A batch run can be started with the following commands:

```
> mkdir gatksv_run && cd gatksv_run
> mkdir wdl && cd wdl
> cp $GATK_SV_ROOT/wdl/*.wdl .
> zip dep.zip *.wdl
> cd ..
> bash scripts/inputs/build_default_inputs.sh -d $GATK_SV_ROOT
> cp $GATK_SV_ROOT/inputs/GATKSVPipelineBatch.ref_panel_1kg.json GATKSVPipelineBatch.my_run.json
> cromshell submit wdl/GATKSVPipelineBatch.wdl GATKSVPipelineBatch.my_run.json cromwell_config.json wdl/dep.zip
```

where `cromwell_config.json` is a Cromwell [workflow options file](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/wf_options/Overview/). Note users will need to re-populate batch/sample-specific parameters (e.g. BAMs and sample IDs).

## <a name="overview">Pipeline Overview</a>
The pipeline consists of a series of modules that perform the following:

* `/scripts`: scripts for running tests, building dockers, and analyzing cromwell metadata files
* `/src`: main pipeline scripts
  * `/RdTest`: scripts for depth testing
  * `/sv-pipeline`: various scripts and packages used throughout the pipeline
  * `/svqc`: Python module for checking that pipeline metrics fall within acceptable limits
  * `/svtest`: Python module for generating various summary metrics from module outputs
  * `/svtk`: Python module of tools for SV-related datafile parsing and analysis
  * `/WGD`: whole-genome dosage scoring scripts
* `/test_input_templates`: WDL test parameter file templates. Generate parameter files from templates using `scripts/inputs/build_default_inputs.sh`.


## <a name="cohort-mode">Cohort mode</a>
A minimum cohort size of 100 with roughly equal number of males and females is recommended. For modest cohorts (~100-500 samples), the pipeline can be run as a single batch using `GATKSVPipelineBatch.wdl`.

For larger cohorts, samples should be split up into batches of about 100-500 samples. Refer to the [Batching](#batching) section for further guidance on creating batches.

The pipeline should be executed as follows:
* Modules [GatherSampleEvidence](#gather-sample-evidence) and [EvidenceQC](#evidence-qc) can be run on arbitrary cohort partitions
* Modules [GatherBatchEvidence](#gather-batch-evidence), [ClusterBatch](#cluster-batch), [GenerateBatchMetrics](#generate-batch-metrics), and [FilterBatch](#filter-batch) are run separately per batch
* [GenotypeBatch](#genotype-batch) is run separately per batch, using filtered variants ([FilterBatch](#filter-batch) output) combined across all batches
* [MakeCohortVcf](#make-cohort-vcf) and beyond are run on all batches together

Note: [GatherBatchEvidence](#gather-batch-evidence) requires a [trained gCNV model](#gcnv-training).

#### <a name="batching">Batching</a>
For larger cohorts, samples should be split up into batches of about 100-500 samples with similar characteristics. We recommend batching based on overall coverage and dosage score (WGD), which can be generated in [EvidenceQC](#evidence-qc). An example batching process is outlined below:
1. Divide the cohort into PCR+ and PCR- samples
2. Partition the samples by median coverage from [EvidenceQC](#evidence-qc), grouping samples with similar median coverage together. The end goal is to divide the cohort into roughly equal-sized batches of about 100-500 samples; if your partitions based on coverage are larger or uneven, you can partition the cohort further in the next step to obtain the final batches. 
3. Optionally, divide the samples further by dosage score (WGD) from [EvidenceQC](#evidence-qc), grouping samples with similar WGD score together, to obtain roughly equal-sized batches of about 100-500 samples
4. Maintain a roughly equal sex balance within each batch, based on sex assignments from [EvidenceQC](#evidence-qc)


## <a name="sample-sample-mode">Single-sample mode</a>
`GATKSVPipelineSingleSample.wdl` runs the pipeline on a single sample using a fixed reference panel. An example reference panel containing 156 samples from the [NYGC 1000G Terra workspace](https://app.terra.bio/#workspaces/anvil-datastorage/1000G-high-coverage-2019) is provided with `inputs/GATKSVPipelineSingleSample.ref_panel_1kg.na12878.json`. 

Custom reference panels can be generated by running `GATKSVPipelineBatch.wdl` and `TrainGCNV.wdl` and using the outputs to replace the following single-sample workflow inputs:

* `GATKSVPipelineSingleSample.ref_ped_file` : `batch.ped` - Manually created (see [data requirements](#requirements))

* `GATKSVPipelineSingleSample.ref_samples` - Reference panel sample IDs
* `GATKSVPipelineSingleSample.ref_std_manta_vcfs` - `std_XXX.manta.sample.vcf.gz` - Standardized Manta VCFs ([GatherBatchEvidence](#gather-batch-evidence))

* `GATKSVPipelineSingleSample.ref_std_wham_vcfs` - `std_XXX.wham.sample.vcf.gz` - Standardized Wham VCFs ([GatherBatchEvidence](#gather-batch-evidence))
* `GATKSVPipelineSingleSample.cutoffs` : `batch.cutoffs` - Filtering cutoffs ([FilterBatch](#filter-batch))
* `GATKSVPipelineSingleSample.genotype_pesr_pesr_sepcutoff` : `genotype_pesr.pesr_sepcutoff.txt` - Genotyping cutoffs ([GenotypeBatch](#genotype-batch))

* `GATKSVPipelineSingleSample.ref_panel_vcf` : `batch.cleaned.vcf.gz` - Final output VCF ([MakeCohortVcf](#make-cohort-vcf))


## <a name="gcnv-training-overview">gCNV Training</a>
Both the cohort and single-sample modes use the GATK gCNV depth calling pipeline, which requires a [trained model](#gcnv-training) as input. The samples used for training should be technically homogeneous and similar to the samples to be processed (i.e. same sample type, library prep protocol, sequencer, sequencing center, etc.). The samples to be processed may comprise all or a subset of the training set. For small, relatively homogenous cohorts, a single gCNV model is usually sufficient. If a cohort contains multiple data sources, we recommend training a separate model for each [batch](#batching) or group of batches with similar dosage score (WGD). The model may be trained on all or a subset of the samples to which it will be applied; a reasonable default is 100 randomly-selected samples from the batch (the random selection can be done as part of the workflow by specifying a number of samples to the `n_samples_subsample` input parameter in `/wdl/TrainGCNV.wdl`).


## <a name="descriptions">Module Descriptions</a>
The following sections briefly describe each module and highlights inter-dependent input/output files. Note that input/output mappings can also be gleaned from `GATKSVPipelineBatch.wdl`, and example input files for each module can be found in `/test_input_templates`.

## <a name="gather-sample-evidence">GatherSampleEvidence</a>
*Formerly Module00a*

Runs raw evidence collection on each sample with the following SV callers: Manta, Wham, and/or MELT. Delly can be enabled but is no longer officially supported. For guidance on pre-filtering prior to `GatherSampleEvidence`, refer to the [Sample Exclusion](#sample-exclusion) section.

Note: a list of sample IDs must be provided. Refer to the [sample ID requirements](#sampleids) for specifications of allowable sample IDs. IDs that do not meet these requirements may cause errors.

#### Inputs:
* Per-sample BAM or CRAM files aligned to hg38. Index files (`.bai`) must be provided if using BAMs.

#### Outputs:
* Caller VCFs (Delly, Manta, MELT, and/or Wham)
* Binned read counts file
* Split reads (SR) file
* Discordant read pairs (PE) file

## <a name="evidence-qc">EvidenceQC</a>
*Formerly Module00b*

Runs ploidy estimation, dosage scoring, and optionally VCF QC. The results from this module can be used for QC and batching.

For large cohorts, this workflow can be run on arbitrary cohort partitions of up to about 500 samples. Afterwards, we recommend using the results to divide samples into smaller batches (~100-500 samples) with ~1:1 male:female ratio. Refer to the [Batching](#batching) section for further guidance on creating batches.

We also recommend using sex assignments generated from the ploidy estimates and incorporating them into the PED file, with sex = 0 for sex aneuploidies.

#### Prerequisites:
* [GatherSampleEvidence](#gather-sample-evidence)

#### Inputs:
* Read count files ([GatherSampleEvidence](#gather-sample-evidence))
* (Optional) SV call VCFs ([GatherSampleEvidence](#gather-sample-evidence))

#### Outputs:
* Per-sample dosage scores with plots
* Median coverage per sample
* Ploidy estimates, sex assignments, with plots
* (Optional) Outlier samples detected by call counts

#### <a name="prelim-sample-qc">Preliminary Sample QC</a>
The purpose of sample filtering at this stage after EvidenceQC is to prevent very poor quality samples from interfering with the results for the rest of the callset. In general, samples that are borderline are okay to leave in, but you should choose filtering thresholds to suit the needs of your cohort and study. There will be future opportunities (as part of [FilterBatch](#filter-batch)) for filtering before the joint genotyping stage if necessary. Here are a few of the basic QC checks that we recommend:
* Look at the X and Y ploidy plots, and check that sex assignments match your expectations. If there are discrepancies, check for sample swaps and update your PED file before proceeding.
* Look at the dosage score (WGD) distribution and check that it is centered around 0 (the distribution of WGD for PCR- samples is expected to be slightly lower than 0, and the distribution of WGD for PCR+ samples is expected to be slightly greater than 0. Refer to the [gnomAD-SV paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2287-8) for more information on WGD score). Optionally filter outliers.
* Look at the low outliers for each SV caller (samples with much lower than typical numbers of SV calls per contig for each caller). An empty low outlier file means there were no outliers below the median and no filtering is necessary. Check that no samples had zero calls.
* Look at the high outliers for each SV caller and optionally filter outliers; samples with many more SV calls than average may be poor quality.


## <a name="gcnv-training">TrainGCNV</a>
Trains a gCNV model for use in [GatherBatchEvidence](#gather-batch-evidence). The WDL can be found at `/wdl/TrainGCNV.wdl`. See the [gCNV training overview](#gcnv-training-overview) for more information.

#### Prerequisites:
* [GatherSampleEvidence](#gather-sample-evidence)

* (Recommended) [EvidenceQC](#evidence-qc)
* [gCNV training](#gcnv-training)

#### Inputs:
* PED file (updated with [EvidenceQC](#evidence-qc) sex assignments, including sex = 0 for sex aneuploidies. Calls will not be made on sex chromosomes when sex = 0 in order to avoid generating many confusing calls or upsetting normalized copy numbers for the batch.)
* Per-sample indexed GVCFs generated with HaplotypeCaller (`gvcfs` input), or a jointly-genotyped VCF (position-sharded, `snp_vcfs` input or `snp_vcfs_shard_list` input). The jointly-genotyped VCF may contain multi-allelic sites and indels, but only biallelic SNVs will be used by the pipeline. We recommend shards of 10 GB or less to lower compute time and resources.

## <a name="module07">Module 07</a> (in development)
Apply downstream filtering steps to the cleaned vcf to further control the false discovery rate; all steps are optional and users should decide based on the specific purpose of their projects.

Filterings methods include:
* minGQ - remove variants based on the genotype quality across populations.
Note: Trio families are required to build the minGQ filtering model in this step. We provide tables pre-trained with the 1000 genomes samples at different FDR thresholds for projects that lack family structures, and they can be found here:

* BatchEffect - remove variants that show significant discrepancies in allele frequencies across batches
* FilterOutlierSamplesPostMinGQ - remove outlier samples with unusually high or low number of SVs
* FilterCleanupQualRecalibration - sanitize filter columns and recalibrate variant QUAL scores for easier interpretation

## <a name="annotate-vcf">AnnotateVcf</a> (in development)
*Formerly Module08Annotation*

Add annotations, such as the inferred function and allele frequencies of variants, to final vcf.

Annotations methods include:
* Functional annotation - annotate SVs with inferred function on protein coding regions, regulatory regions such as UTR and Promoters and other non coding elements;
* Allele Frequency annotation - annotate SVs with their allele frequencies across all samples, and samples of specific sex, as well as specific sub-populations.
* Allele Frequency annotation with external callset - annotate SVs with the allele frequencies of their overlapping SVs in another callset, eg. gnomad SV callset.

## <a name="module09">Module 09</a> (in development)
Visualize SVs with [IGV](http://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/) screenshots and read depth plots.

Visualization methods include:
* RD Visualization - generate RD plots across all samples, ideal for visualizing large CNVs.
* IGV Visualization - generate IGV plots of each SV for individual sample, ideal for visualizing de novo small SVs.
* Module09.visualize.wdl - generate RD plots and IGV plots, and combine them for easy review.

### VM runs out of memory or disk
* Default pipeline settings are tuned for batches of 100 samples. Larger batches or cohorts may require additional VM resources. Most runtime attributes can be modified through the `RuntimeAttr` inputs. These are formatted like this in the json:
```
"MyWorkflow.runtime_attr_override": {
  "disk_gb": 100,
  "mem_gb": 16
},
```
Note that a subset of the struct attributes can be specified. See `wdl/Structs.wdl` for available attributes.


### Calculated read length causes error in MELT workflow

Example error message from `GatherSampleEvidence.MELT.GetWgsMetrics`:
```
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: The requested index 701766 is out of counter bounds. Possible cause of exception can be wrong READ_LENGTH parameter (much smaller than actual read length)
```

This error message was observed for a sample with an average read length of 117, but for which half the reads were of length 90 and half were of length 151. As a workaround, override the calculated read length by providing a `read_length` input of 151 (or the expected read length for the sample in question) to `GatherSampleEvidence`.
